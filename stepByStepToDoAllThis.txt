**STEP-BY-STEP, what we have done in this Major Project**

use "cd .." to go one folder back
use "cd ./codeial" to go inside codeial folder
write 'npm init'
Now, write necessary information otherwise press enter, so that default values will be taken
"Now package.json" file will appear in tthe codeial folder

to clear terminal use, ctrl + k

now to make a new directory, use "mkdir routes"
then create other folder also with name :- "controllers, views, models, config" using the above syntax !!

/* JUST FOR INFO
routes : stores all destinations from browser, i.e. stores /home, /profile, etc
controllers : when above links are called i.e. when /home or /profile are called then which controller will be called and what actions will be taken, all those controllers are stored in this folder
views : stores the html, ejs files
models : stores all schemas
config : holds all the configurations, mongodb settings will be stored in this folder
*/

npm install express
Now, express is added to the package.json and a new file called package-lock.json also appears which contains all dependencies that express requires
Also, node_modules folder appears

Now, we start writing in index.js :-
/*
const express= require('express');
const app= express();
const port= 8000;

app.listen(port, function(err) {
    if(err) {
        console.log(`Error in running the server : ${err}`);
    }
    console.log(`Server is running on port: ${port}`);
})
*/

Now, to run server, we use "nodemon index.js"

But instead of always writing "nodemon index.js", we can create a shortcut by going to package.json and inside "script", put a new line as, follows :-
/*
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
},
*/
Now, we can use "npm start" to start our server

Now, initialising our git repository for this project :-
write:-
git init

git remote add origin git@github.com:PiyushBhatnagar09/MajorProject-1.git
/* we got the above link git@..... by creating a new repository on github*/

git status
/*it will show all the files we have and there we can see there is node_modules file also
node_modules is a heavy folder and we don't want it to go to our github repository, so :-*/

create .gitignore in the codeial folder
write "node_modules/" inside that file and then do "git status", now you can see there is no node_modules
